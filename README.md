# VasPicksMod
Rebalance RVGL Pickups and play online with others

## Latest version: 1.0 (21.0326):
* _Pickups have been rebalanced._
* You can't get a bomb or a ball in last.
* Drastically reduced probability of getting a zap or a battery in 1st.
* 1st place bomb is rarer than last place star.

### More changes:
* Shockwave redistribuited to be better balanced in all positions.
* Single rocket is much more common in 1st.
* Rocket pack is generally more common.
* Bomb is very rare in all positions, with greater probability in the mid spots; impossible to get in last.
* Water Balloon rebalanced to be more common in mid to lower positions.
* Central spots yield the highest chance of getting a zap.
* Oil is more commmon in mid spots.
* Ball is more frequent in 1st and it's impossible to get in last.
* Battery distributed in the mid to lower spots, with the highest chance in last.
* Fake pickup is more common in the top spots.
* Global Weapon (Star) is slightly more common than before (3% in last, instead of 1%).


## Installation instructions:

### Normal install:

* The mod is based on the 32-bit version of the game. Since most systems now are 64-bit, I will include the 32-bit dlls and exe, but the only file required to run is VasPicksMod.exe.
* Installation is easy: extract the whole package on top of your current installation, or othewise make sure you have all 32-bit dlls and rvgl.exe in the same folder as VasPicksMod.exe
* To run the game with the mod: simply run VasPicksMod.exe

### RVGL Launcher install:

* Using the launcher will make the game a bit harder to run, but it's still possible and does not require too much user intervention.
* Installation is not too difficult: extract the whole package in %localappdata%\rvmm\packs\rvglmod\ (create the folder if it doesn't exist)
* To run the game with the mod: you can't start the mod using the launcher and running VasPicksMod.exe directly will yield errors about game data and strings missing; you have to use the shortcut included in the zip file. It is a fully functional shortcut that will run the game with the correct parameters, using the default profile of the rvgl launcher (which you can still edit from the launcher and changes will take effect).

## TLDR:

* If you are NOT using the launcher: extract the zip in the main folder and run "VasPicksMod.exe"
* If you are using the launcher: extract the zip in %localappdata%\rvmm\packs\rvglmod\ and run "VasPicksMod.exe - Shortcut.lnk"
